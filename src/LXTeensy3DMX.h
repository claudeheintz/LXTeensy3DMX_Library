   The LXTeensyDMX library supports output and input of DMX using the UART
   serial output of a Teensy 3.2++'s microcontroller.
   
   This is the circuit for a simple unisolated DMX Shield
   that could be used with LXTeensyDMX.  It uses a line driver IC
   to convert the output from the Teensy to DMX:

RX (0) |----------------------|              |                 DMX Output
       |                 +----| 2        B 7 |---------------- Pin 2
       |                 |    |              |

TX (1) |----------------------| 4 DI   Gnd 5 |---+------------ Pin 1
       |                                         |
       |                                       (GND)

       Data Enable (DE) and Inverted Read Enable (!RE) can be wired to +5v for output or Gnd for input
       if direction switching is not needed.

   LXTeensyDMX is a driver for sending or receiving DMX using a Teensy 3.1/3.2's
   UART0 RX pin 0, TX pin 1
   
   LXTeensyDMX output mode continuously sends DMX once its interrupts have been enabled using startOutput().
   Use setSlot() to set the level value for a particular DMX dimmer/address/channel.
   
   LXTeensyDMX input mode continuously receives DMX once its interrupts have been enabled using startInput()
   Use getSlot() to read the level value for a particular DMX dimmer/address/channel.
   
   LXTeensyDMX is used with a single instance called Teensy3DMX	.
